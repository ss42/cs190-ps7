 # CS 190 Problem Set #7&mdash;RSA Cryptography Part II
 
 [Course Home Page]( http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/classes/CS190_S16/index.html )
 
 Due: Tuesday, April 12th, 2016.
 
 ## Reading that is Related to this Week's Lectures and/or This Problem Set
 
 This is Part II of the RSA Cryptography Problem Set begun last week.

 For this problem set, we are going to finish Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptography following the Wikibook [A Basic Public Key Example]( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Basic_Public_Key_Example ). For convenience I snarfed a printable copy of the first six sections into cs190-ps6. That's the cookbook you will be following.
 
 The Wikibook is too much a cookbook, and that can be good, but if you want to understand the mathematical identities that make RSA cryptography true, then this is a better reference: [Prime Number Hide-and-Seek: How the RSA Cipher Works]( http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/rsa.html ). I snarfed a printable copy of that into this project.
 
 ## Directions Specific to this Problem Set
 
 In my implementation of RSA.publicKey(), you'll see that I used the coprimes utility you implemented last week.
 
 Your job is to implement the following two methods on the class RSA:
 
 1. (3 pts) RSA.privateKey() -> PrivateKey
 
 2. (2 pts) RSA.decrypt(cipherValue: Int) -> Int
 
 If you do them correctly, all the unit tests will pass.
 
 I am not going to pretend these two problems are easy. They are short, but they are hard because:
 
 * You have to read and understand the section titled "Making Site B's Private KEY" to implement RSA.privateKey().
 * You have to read and understand the section titled "Decryption with B's Private Key" to implement RSA.decrypt().
 * You have to read and understand most of the material prior to those sections.
 
 ## General Directions for all Problem Sets
 
 1. Fork this repository to create a repository in your own Github account. Then clone your fork to whatever machine you are working on.
 
 2. These problem sets are created with the latest version of Xcode and Mac OS X: Xcode 7.3 and OS X 10.11.4. I haven't tested how well this problem set will work under Xcode 7.2.1. Please go into Galileo 205, 206 or 208 and test your work rather than relying on the Xcode 7.2.1 machines in Garaventa.
 
 3. Under no circumstances copy-and-paste any part of a solution from another student in the class. Also, under no circumstances ask outsiders on Stack Exchange or other programmers' forums to help you create your solution. It is however fine&mdash;especially when you are truly stuck&mdash;to ask others to help you with your solution, provided you do all of the typing. They should only be looking over your shoulder and commenting. It is of course also fine to peruse StackExchange and whatever other resources you find helfpul.
 
 4. Your solution should be clean and exhibit good style. At minimum, Xcode should not flag warnings of any kind. Your style should match Apple's as shown by their examples and declarations. Use the same indentation and spacing around operators as Apple uses. Use their capitalization conventions. Use parts of speech and grammatical number the same way as Apple does. Use descriptive names for variables. Avoid acronyms or abbreviations. I am still coming up to speed on good Swift style. When there appears to be conflict my style and Apple's, copy Apple's, not mine.
 
 5. When completed, before the class the problem set is due, commit your changes to your fork of the repository. I should be able to simply clone your fork, build it and execute it in my environment without encountering any warnings, adding any dependencies or making any modifications.
 
 ## Utility Implementations from Last Week

This particular case must be avoided by deliberate testing since a hacker would likely test for this possibility early in the process of an attack. In the above examples, this would have been the case if 9, 11, 21, 33 or 39 were chosen for the public key instead of some other. Lest it be thought that anticipation of this error is simple, notice that even in this set that both coprimes that are themselves prime (eg; leading to: 11 * 11 = 1 mod 40), and those that are coprime but not in themselves prime (eg; 9, 21, 33, and 39), can all produce this insecure state of affairs." **** //
